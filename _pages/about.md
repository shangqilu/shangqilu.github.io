### About Me

Shangqi Lu is currently an Assistant Professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in the [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Prior to this, he was a Research Engineer at Huawei. He obtained his doctoral degree in 2022 at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, honorably advised by Prof. [Yufei Tao](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/). He obtained his bachelor's degree from the Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2018.

**Research Interests.** Designing algorithms with non-trivial theoretical guarantees and applying them to practical database systems. My focus lies in exploring topics such as database query processing, high-dimensional computational geometry, information retrieval, and machine learning.


**I am looking for PhD students and Research Assistants.** Please send me your CV and detailed transcript if you are interested. The accepted student is expected to research on both practical and theoretical algorithms on large-scale data.
